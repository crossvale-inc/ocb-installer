Step 1: clone to box

To install OCB:
===============
Step 2: `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yaml -p playbooks/roles` (this will install the roles locally instead of in /etc/ansible/roles)
Step 3: copy the folder ./inventory/local to create your target environment, for instance, to ./inventory/dev-crossvale/ and fill out the hosts file, the config.js, the OCP inventory and ssh_config according to your needs.

WARNING!! This installer is meant to work with an external docker registry to pull the images from. Not to push OCB images directly to the OCP's internal registry.
Step 4: ansible-playbook -i /inventory/<target environment>/hosts playbooks/prepare-images.yaml, to pull the images from Crossvale's Official Docker registry and push them to your Stagging docker registry in Nexus or Artifactory.

Step 5: ansible-playbook -i /inventory/<target environment>/hosts playbooks/install.yaml

To uninstall OCB:
=================
WARNING!! The CRDs are not deleted in case there is more than one deployment within the same OCP cluster.
Step 2: ansible-playbook -i /inventory/<target environment>/hosts playbooks/uninstall.yaml
